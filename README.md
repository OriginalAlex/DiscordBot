This is a fairly simple Discord selfbot I have been working on which aims to facilitate certain aspects of Discord and provide easy access to certain information (and of course some superfluous fun commands)


#**In its current states, the commands are:**
- me.wiki [Article Name] --> Returns the first paragraph of a wikipedia article in an aesthetic message embed.
- me.crypto [Cryptocurrency] --> Returns information on a cryptocurrency such as its price, market cap, 24 hour volume and circulating supply
